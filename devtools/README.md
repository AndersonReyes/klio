# klio-devtools

Utilities to make klio development a little easier.


## Utilities included

* `klio-dev` entrypoint that points to the exact same path as `klio-cli` (allowing it to be easier to have both a global installation and local-to-env installation), i.e. `(env) klio-dev job run`, versus `(env) /Users/lynn/.pyenv/shims/klio job run`.
