Abstract
--------
The abstract should be a short description of what the KEP will achieve.


Motivation and Scope
--------------------
This section describes the need for the proposed change.
It should describe the existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to solve, and why.
This section should explicitly address the scope of and key requirements for the proposed change.


Usage and Impact
----------------
This section describes how users of Klio will use features described in this KEP.
It should be comprised mainly of code examples that wouldn't be possible without acceptance and implementation of this KEP, as well as the impact the proposed changes would have on the ecosystem.
This section should be written from the perspective of the users of Klio, and the benefits it will provide them; and as such, it should include implementation details only if necessary to explain the functionality.


Backward compatibility
----------------------
This section describes the ways in which the KEP breaks backward compatibility.

Its purpose is to provide a high-level summary to users who are not interested in detailed technical discussion, but may have opinions around, e.g., usage and impact.


Detailed description
--------------------

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed change.
It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used, intended use-cases and pseudo-code illustrating its use.


Related Work
------------

This section should list relevant and/or similar technologies, possibly in other libraries.
It does not need to be comprehensive, just list the major examples of prior and relevant art.


Implementation
--------------

This section lists the major steps required to implement the KEP.
Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which steps may be optionally omitted.
Where it makes sense, each step should include a link to related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this KEP should be linked to from here.
(A KEP does not need to be implemented in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).


Alternatives
------------

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.


Discussion
----------
This section may just be a bullet list including links to any discussions regarding the KEP.


References and Footnotes
------------------------

Include any relevant references and footnotes.
