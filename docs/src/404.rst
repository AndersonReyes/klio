.. note: When going to a nonexistent page locally, this won't render because the internal
   local sphinx server doesn't handle 404 -> 404.html mappings.
   Going to localhost:8888/404.html will look broken since it's looking for assets at the full
   URL (/en/latest/_static/... versus /_static/...). This should work when deployed.

404 - Page Not Found
====================

We could not find this page!

If you believe this is a mistake, please file an `issue <https://github.com/spotify/klio/issues>`_.
