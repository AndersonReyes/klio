21.12.0
=======

Load Klio Config from Main Session
----------------------------------
Klio now uses Apache Beam's main session to load the Klio config file onto workers. Klio config fields are defined in the ``klio-job.yaml`` and can also be overridden [#f1]_ when running a pipeline. The final config fields are serialized as the ``KlioConfig`` object, saved into the main session, and loaded by Dataflow workers upon starting up. As a result, Klio jobs no longer need to include ``.effective-klio-job.yaml`` and ``klio-job-run-effective.yaml`` in the job's docker image.

This change is dependent on a bug fix available in ``apache-beam>=2.31.0``. Klio jobs using a version lower than this should upgrade ``apache-beam``.


Metrics
-------
The Stackdriver log-based metric client, which has been deprecated since March 2021, has been removed in this release.


Verifying GCP Roles
-------------------
The release of ``21.12.0`` also includes minor improvements to the user experience when verifying a Klio job and adding GCP roles to a job's service account.
