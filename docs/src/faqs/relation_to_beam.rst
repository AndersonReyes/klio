How does Klio relate to Apache Beam?
====================================

Klio is built on top of Apache Beam for Python.
By default, Klio provides an :violetemph:`opinionated` way to use Apache Beam for common media processing use cases, but allows the use of core Python Beam at any time if Klioâ€™s opinions don't fit your use case.

Klio aims to be a more :violetemph:`Pythonic` implementation of the Beam framework, but it also offers several advantages over traditional Python Beam for media processing.
Klio provides a substantial reduction in boilerplate code (an average of 60%), a focus on heavy file I/O, and provides existing standards for connecting multiple streaming jobs together in a :doc:`DAG <../userguide/anatomy/graph>` (with :ref:`top-down<top-down>` and :ref:`bottom-up<bottom-up>` execution).
This allows teams to immediately focus on writing new pipelines, with the knowledge that they can easily be extended and connected later.
