How does Klio compare to Spotify Scio?
======================================

Both projects bring Apache Beam to new domains: `Scio <https://github.com/spotify/scio>`_ brings Beam pipelines to Scala, while Klio focuses Beam on analyzing, manipulating, and transforming large binary media (e.g. images, audio, video) where the content in its native form canâ€™t really fit or be analyzed in a database in any meaningful way.
