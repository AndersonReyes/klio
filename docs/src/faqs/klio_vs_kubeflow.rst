How does Klio compare to Kubeflow?
==================================

`Kubeflow <https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/kubeflow/>`_ is a very powerful platform that uses `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_ under the hood to help construct workflows.
Kubeflow allows its users to process data and to use that data to experiment & train ML models.


On the other hand, Klio takes complex algorithms, whether a trained ML model or a media processing algorithm, and enables deployment within research or production pipelines with the focus on optimizing for heavy file I/O and its related resources.
