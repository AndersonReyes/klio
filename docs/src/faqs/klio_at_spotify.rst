What is Klio used for at Spotify?
=================================

Spotify built Klio as a :blueemph:`standardized framework` for running audio analysis allowing teams to share a common useful foundation instead of duplicating each others' work.
It reduces the operational and backend engineering load on these teams, allowing them to focus on doing the processing, machine learning, or otherwise algorithmic work that they excel at.

Spotify uses Klio to run its audio intelligence platforms, which powers things like the `Audio Features <https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/>`_, aspects of our audio ad platform, and our audio research workflow.
Spotify teams use Klio for tasks like running Tensorflow models over audio files, creating new audio from existing audio in areas like audio fingerprinting and ad generation, and saving analyzed data to databases.
