Does Klio allow you to use native Beam components?
==================================================

Yes, definitely. Klio's design is meant to enhance Beam's primitives (`Pipeline <https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline>`_, `PCollections <https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#pcollections>`_, `Transforms <https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#transforms>`_, etc.).
Write a Klio pipeline should feel very similar to writing a Beam pipeline.
