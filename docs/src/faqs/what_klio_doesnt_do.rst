What doesn't Klio do?
=====================

Klio does not provide pre-built connectors to your media storage or rights management systems. You will have to tailor these to your existing infrastructure.

Klio does not provide any built-in media processing algorithms beyond simple tasks for audio, like downloading from Google Cloud Storage, and basic transforms that wrap `librosa`_.
Check out our :doc:`klio-audio <../reference/audio/index>` for more information.
